# python-for-ml

This project contains Python scripts for basic machine learning workflows, including data preprocessing and model training/evaluation.

## 1. preprocessing
This script handles data preprocessing steps:
- Filling missing numerical values
- Label encoding for categorical columns
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler

## 2. ml
This script provides machine learning utilities:
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Training a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluating the model using accuracy and a classification report
